# Amylase

Amylase is an enzyme used in the brewing process that converts 
long-chained starch molecules found in barley to simpler 
fermentable sugars.  Amylase is also the name of this 
Rails project, which is designed to take a mix of sequences of job tasks 
and split them up into smaller work units.  Ok, so it's really just a 
job scheduler, but it's a job scheduler with a cool name, right?
