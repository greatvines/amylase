# Amylase

Amylase is an extremely important enzyme that is part of the beer
brewing process.  The barley used in brewing is packed with very long
starch molecules that need to be broken down into smaller sugars like
maltose in order to converted into alcohol by the yeast.  **Amylase** is
the enzyme that converts these long polymers into simple sugars.
